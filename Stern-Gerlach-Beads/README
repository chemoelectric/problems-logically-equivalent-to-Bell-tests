This directory will contain description and analysis of the
Stern-Gerlach Beads, an actual apparatus I have made.

It is a box that you shake to distribute black and white beads
randomly on two sides of a divider that is set according to the angle
of a Stern-Gerlach magnet. The statistics will agree with the quantum
mechanics for an EPR-Bohm experiment with a Stern-Gerlach magnet.

The pairing of particles is, in fact, arbitrary (regardless of the
PURELY MATHEMATICAL ‘superposition’ that is created in state space
calculations). Thus shaking the Stern-Gerlach Beads with different
settings of the separator can be done to duplicate the Bell test.
