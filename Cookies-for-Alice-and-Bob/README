A little word problem, involving cookies and cosines, that is
equivalent to a two-channel Bell test experiment with photons. A
solution is included.

Available as any of

  * a two-page PDF
  * a pair of PNG images

and released into the public domain.

(Because the solution doubles as a classical solution of the Bell test
experiment, agreement that the solution is valid will make you
ineligible for the Nobel Prize in Physics.)
