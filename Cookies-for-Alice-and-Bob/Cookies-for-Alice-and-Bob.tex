\title{Cookies for Alice and Bob}

\subject{The Problem}

\startitemize[n]
\item You have one box of Chocolate Cookies and one box of Vanilla
  Cookies.
\item You will deliver one of the boxes to Alice and one of the boxes
  to Bob. Neither has a preference of flavor.
\item You flip a coin to decide who gets which box.\footnote{This step
  is equivalent to a light source generating a pair of perpendicularly
  polarized photons.}
\item Alice has a favorite angle,~$\alpha$. Bob also has a favorite
  angle,~$\beta$. You write down the numbers $\cos^2\alpha$,
  $\sin^2\alpha$, $\cos^2\beta$, and~$\sin^2\beta$. Also, you have a
  pair of ten-sided dice. You can roll these dice to get a number
  between~$0.00$ and~$0.99$, inclusive.
\item Suppose Alice is getting the box of Chocolate Cookies. You roll
  the dice. If the number you roll is less than
  $\cos^2\alpha$, then you write~$+1$ on the box. Otherwise
  you write~$-1$.\footnote{This is equivalent to a photon being
    detected in one of the channels of a polarizing beam splitter.}
\item Suppose, on the other hand, that Alice is getting the box of
  Vanilla Cookies. You roll the dice.  If the number you roll is less
  than $\sin^2\alpha$, then you write~$+1$ on the
  box. Otherwise you write~$-1$.
\item Suppose Bob is getting the box of Chocolate Cookies. You roll
  the dice. If the number you roll is less than
  $\cos^2\beta$, then you write~$+1$ on the box. Otherwise
  you write~$-1$.
\item Suppose, on the other hand, that Bob is getting the box of
  Vanilla Cookies. You roll the dice.  If the number you roll is less
  than $\sin^2\beta$, then you write~$+1$ on the
  box. Otherwise you write~$-1$.
\item Calculate the correlation coefficient of the numbers written on
  the cookie boxes, as a function of~$\alpha-\beta$.\footnote{The
    answer from quantum mechanics is~$-\!\cos\,2(\alpha-\beta)$, and
    physicists assure us only quantum mechanical systems can achieve
    this solution. According to physicists, even logically equivalent
    systems cannot do so, because they have no entangled superposition
    states nor action at a distance!}

\subject{The Solution}

First let us solve the problem for $\alpha=\alpha_0$
and~$\beta=\beta_0=0$. For this particular case we have
\startformula
  \startmathalignment [n=2, align={right,left}]
    \NC\cos^2\alpha\NC=\cos^2\alpha_0 \NR
    \NC\sin^2\alpha\NC=\sin^2\alpha_0 \NR
    \NC\cos^2\beta\NC= 1 \NR
    \NC\sin^2\beta\NC= 0 \NR
  \stopmathalignment
\stopformula
The choice of markings as $\{+1,-1\}$ makes the correlation
coefficient simple to compute. It is
\startformula
\rho_0=\rho_0^{++}+\rho_0^{+-}+\rho_0^{-+}+\rho_0^{--}
\stopformula
where
\startformula
  \startmathalignment [n=2, align={right,left}]
    % The roll for Bob always succeeds for Chocolate, always fails for
    % Vanilla.
    \NC\rho_0^{++}\NC=\frac{1}{2}(+1)(+1)\sin^2\alpha_0\NR % Vanilla/Choc
    \NC\rho_0^{+-}\NC=\frac{1}{2}(+1)(-1)\cos^2\alpha_0\NR % Choc/Vanilla
    \NC\rho_0^{-+}\NC=\frac{1}{2}(-1)(+1)\cos^2\alpha_0\NR % Vanilla/Choc
    \NC\rho_0^{--}\NC=\frac{1}{2}(-1)(-1)\sin^2\alpha_0\NR % Choc/Vanilla
  \stopmathalignment
\stopformula
Thus (by a double-angle identity found in reference books)
\startformula
  \rho_0=-(\cos^2\alpha_0-\sin^2\alpha_0)=-\cos\,2\alpha_0
\stopformula
Let~$\alpha=\alpha_0+\beta$. Then~$\beta=\beta_0+\beta$, so~$\beta$ is
a change of angular coordinates. Now~$\rho_0$ is the desired solution,
so rename it~$\rho$ without the subscript. The solution is
\startformula
  \rho=-\cos\,2(\alpha-\beta)
\stopformula
Although the particular ‘scattering’ of~$+1$ and~$-1$ marks (were a
person to do the operation many times) depends on the specific values
of~$\alpha$ and~$\beta$, the correlation coefficient depends only on
the difference~$\alpha-\beta$. There is a relationship between~$+1$
and~$-1$ marks that is invariant under in-unison rotation of the
angles.\footnote{This solution is the same as the one from quantum
  mechanics. Of course, the same rotational invariance was always true
  of Bell test experiments, but little remarked on. But be forewarned:
  there are many ‘doctors of philosophy’ who would object to my
  solution yet are permitted to teach university classes.}~$\square$
