\title{Stern-Gerlach Shutters}

\subject{The Problem}

\startitemize[n]

\item The Stern-Gerlach Scientific Contraption Company makes a device
  called a Stern-Gerlach Shutter. One of these is depicted
  in~\in{Figure}[fig:shutter].

\placefigure[][fig:shutter]{Stern-Gerlach Shutter}{\externalfigure[Stern-Gerlach-Shutter-2.png][width=2.25in]}

\item The settings gauge at the bottom of the device is set at a
  desired angle between zero and~$\pi$. The shutter sheet slides
  horizontally, guided by a long bar that is connected to the rotating
  handle, and which can slide vertically through a tube at the left
  edge of the shutter sheet.

\item The shutter sheet is used to cover a rectangular opening that is
  centered over the settings gaugeâ€™s pivot. The width of the opening
  is equal to the diameter of the semicircle swept out by the settings
  gauge.

\item We have two of these Stern-Gerlach Shutters, and for each one a
  corresponding Stern-Gerlach Shutter Shooter. A Stern-Gerlach Shutter
  Shooter fires a pellet at a random point inside the boundaries of
  the opening of a Stern-Gerlach Shutter. The pellet may either pass
  through the opening or bounce off the shutter sheet. The Shutter
  Shooter may fire either a black pellet or a white pellet, at the
  discretion of the experimenter.

\item Shutter~1 is set to~$\phi_1$ and~Shutter~2 is set to~$\phi_2$.

\item According to the flip of a fair coin, we shoot either a black
  pellet at~Shutter~1 and a white pellet at~Shutter~2, or the other
  way around.

\item Let~$+1$ represent either a black pellet passing through an
  opening or a white pellet bouncing off a shutter sheet. Let~$-1$
  represent pellets doing it the other way around.

\item Compute, for the two Stern-Gerlach shutters, the correlation
  coefficient~$\rho$ as a function of~$\phi_1-\phi_2$.
