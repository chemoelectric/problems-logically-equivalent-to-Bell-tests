\title{Stern-Gerlach Shutters}

\subject{The Problem}

\startitemize[n]

\item The Stern-Gerlach Scientific Contraption Company makes a device
  called a Stern-Gerlach Shutter. One of these is depicted
  in~\in{Figure}[fig:shutter].

  \placefigure[][fig:shutter]{Stern-Gerlach Shutter}{\externalfigure[Stern-Gerlach-Shutter-2.png][width=2.45in]}

\item The settings gauge at the bottom of the device is set at a
  desired angle between zero and~$\pi$. The shutter sheet slides
  horizontally, guided by a long bar that is connected to the rotating
  gauge, and which can slide vertically through a tube at the left
  edge of the shutter sheet.

\item The shutter sheet is used to cover a rectangular opening that is
  centered over the settings gauge’s pivot. The width of the opening
  is equal to the diameter of the semicircle swept out by the settings
  gauge.

\item We have two of these Stern-Gerlach Shutters, and for each one a
  corresponding Stern-Gerlach Shutter Shooter. A Stern-Gerlach Shutter
  Shooter fires a pellet at a random point inside the boundaries of
  the opening of a Stern-Gerlach Shutter. The pellet may either pass
  through the opening or bounce off the shutter sheet. The Shutter
  Shooter may fire either a black pellet or a white pellet, at the
  discretion of the experimenter.

\item Shutter~1 is set to~$\phi_1$ and~Shutter~2 is set to~$\phi_2$.

\item According to the flip of a fair coin, we shoot either a black
  pellet at~Shutter~1 and a white pellet at~Shutter~2, or the other
  way around.

\item Let~$+1$ represent either a black pellet passing through an
  opening or a white pellet bouncing off a shutter sheet. Let~$-1$
  represent pellets doing it the other way around.

\item Compute, for the two Stern-Gerlach shutters, the correlation
  coefficient~$\rho$ as a function of~$\phi_1-\phi_2$.

\subject{The Solution}

\startitemize[n]

\item \in{Figure}[fig:shutterannot] depicts important dimensions of a
  Stern-Gerlach Shutter.

  \placefigure[][fig:shutterannot]{Dimensions of a Stern-Gerlach
    Shutter}{\externalfigure[Stern-Gerlach-Shutter-annotated-2.png][width=2.55in]}

\item For convenience, let the radius of the settings gauge equal
  one. Therefore the diameter equals two and the width of the opening
  is also two.

\item Refer to the settings gauge’s setting as~$\phi$. The projection
  of the gauge onto horizontal is~$\cos\phi$.

\item By double-angle identities in the {\it CRC Handbook of
  Mathematical Sciences},
  \startformula
    \cos\phi=\cos^2(\phi/2)-\sin^2(\phi/2)=2\cos^2(\phi/2)-1=1-2\sin^2(\phi/2)
  \stopformula

\item As shown in~\in{Figure}[fig:shutterannot], these identities
  imply the shutter sheet divides the width of the opening
  into~$2\cos^2(\phi/2)$ and~$2\sin^2(\phi/2)$.

\item Thus the shutter sheet divides the area of the opening into
  proportions~$\cos^2(\phi/2)$ and~$\sin^2(\phi/2)$.

\item The probability of a pellet passing through the opening is
  therefore~$\cos^2(\phi/2)$, and the probability of it bouncing off
  the shutter sheet is~$\sin^2(\phi/2)$.

\item Let us solve for the case~$\phi_1=\phi_{01}\in[0,\pi]$,
  $\phi_2=\phi_{02}=0$. Shutter~2 is fully open, so one merely counts
  black pellets as~$+1$ and white pellets as~$-1$. It is as if there
  were no shutter sheet at all, and in fact one need not bother
  shooting at~Shutter~2.

\item For this special case,
  \startformula
    \rho=\rho^{++}+\rho^{+-}+\rho^{-+}+\rho^{--}
  \stopformula
  where
  \startformula
    \startmathalignment [n=2, align={right,left}]
      \NC\rho^{++}\NC=(+1)(+1)\sin^2(\phi_{01}/2)/2\NR
      \NC\rho^{+-}\NC=(+1)(-1)\cos^2(\phi_{01}/2)/2\NR
      \NC\rho^{-+}\NC=(-1)(+1)\cos^2(\phi_{01}/2)/2\NR
      \NC\rho^{--}\NC=(-1)(-1)\sin^2(\phi_{01}/2)/2\NR
    \stopmathalignment
  \stopformula
  The calculation above is for the covariance. The correlation
  coefficient is covariance with its range normalized to~$[-1,+1]$,
  but this covariance already has that.

\item Using the double-angle identities again, $\rho$~simplifies to
  \startformula
    \rho = -(\cos^2\frac{\phi_{01}}{2}-\sin^2\frac{\phi_{01}}{2})
    =-\cos\phi_{01}=-\cos(\phi_{01}-\phi_{02})
  \stopformula

\item Suppose one is given~$\phi_1$ and~$\phi_2$ as the respective
  settings. Assume~$\phi_1\ge\phi_2$. (Otherwise you can simply
  reverse their roles, because cosine is symmetric around the origin.)
  Then let~$\phi_{01}=\phi_1-\phi_2$ and~$\phi_{02}=0=\phi_2-\phi_2$,
  and add~$\phi_2$ to both sides of the minus sign
  in~$\phi_{01}-\phi_{02}$.
  \startformula
    \startmathalignment [n=2, align={right,left}]
      \NC\rho\NC=-\cos(\phi_{01}-\phi_{02}) \NR
      \NC    \NC=-\cos((\phi_1-\phi_2)-(\phi_2-\phi_2)) \NR
      \NC    \NC=-\cos(\phi_1-\phi_2) \NR
    \stopmathalignment
  \stopformula

\item And there we have it, the general solution:
  $\rho = -\cos(\phi_1-\phi_2)$. It is invariant under in-unison
  rotations of the settings.

\subject{Alternative Solution by Quantum Mechanics}

\startitemize[n]

\item A solution by quantum mechanics is much more complicated, so no
  wonder quantum mechanics is considered arcane and difficult. Because
  all mathematical methods\footnote{{\it When employed correctly\/}!}
  must reach the same result, quantum mechanics is never necessary to
  solve a problem. Thus one might consider not using it.

\item Nevertheless, let us use it here. I have not had coursework in
  quantum mechanics and so will try to figure this out for
  myself. Otherwise, one may look up an analysis of the EPR-Bohm
  problem for Stern-Gerlach magnets. A similar analysis ought to apply
  to Stern-Gerlach Shutters. Beware I do not intend to use notations
  conventional in physics.

\item Possible states of our calculation will be represented as a
  linear space. We attribute no physical meaning to this space. The
  points in the space represent states in a symbolic calculation of
  the correlation coefficient.

\item Either of the two pellets has its own linear space that is more
  primitive than the ‘full’ linear space. Let~$\eblack$ represent the
  basis vector for a black pellet and~$\ewhite$ the basis vector for a
  white pellet. Then these vectors form a linear space. So-called
  ‘superpositions’ can be formed from linear combinations of the two
  basis vectors.

\item However, for them to be ‘superpositions’, there is a constraint
  on these linear combinations. The scalar multipliers of the
  components may be real or complex numbers, but the sums of the
  squares of the absolute values of those multipliers must equal one.
  This constraint is like a convex combination (such as one
  encounters, for instance, in de Casteljau’s algorithm), except with
  squares of absolute values instead of the multipliers
  themselves.\footnote{The constraint opaquely relates quantum
    mechanics to probability theory, in which the probabilities of
    mutually exclusive propositions are nonnegative real numbers that
    must add up to one. Multiplying a vector’s multiplier by its
    complex conjugate gives what likely, in a different approach to
    the same problem, would be stated as the probability of some event
    occurring. Thus ‘superposition’ implies that there is referenced,
    within all the bewildering notations, some mutually exclusive but
    complete set of possible events. (What many have inferred instead
    from it belongs more properly to psychiatry than to physics.)}

\item The full linear space will have as basis ordered pairs of the
  form~$\ebew$ or~$\eweb$.\footnote{This space is a subspace of the
    tensor product of the spaces for~Pellet~1 and~Pellet~2. Dirac
    notation obscures that this is just a linear space with an obvious
    set of ordered pairs as basis.}  It also is subject to the
  ‘superposition’ constraint.

\item Now let us make it clear that the state space represents {\it
  the state of a calculation}, and {\it not\/} the physical state of
  the experiment. There is no constraint on the shooting of~Pellet~1
  and~Pellet~2 being done simultaneously. If a settings gauge be set
  at zero, no shooting is necessary at all.\footnote{Similar
    observations are true of experiments with photons, electrons,
    etc., although physicists have not realized this. Conservation
    laws, not ‘superposition’, account for particles occurring in
    pairs.} Nevertheless, the result of the flip of the fair coin will
  be the superposition~$e^{i\pi/4}\ebew+e^{i\pi/4}\eweb$. We might
  have used~$\sqrt{1/2}$ instead of~$e^{i\pi/4}$, but complex number
  multipliers let us more easily represent what a Stern-Gerlach
  Shutter does.

\item Actually, hardly anyone one knows what a Stern-Gerlach Shutter
  does ‘quantum mechanically’, except the wizards at the Stern-Gerlach
  company. They inform us that a Stern-Gerlach Shutter set to~$\phi$
  multiplies~$\eblack$ by~$e^{i\phi/2}$ and~$\ewhite$
  by~$e^{-i\phi/2}$.\footnote{One can deduce these operations from the
    known solution that was obtained more sensibly. Now deduce the
    other way: a Stern-Gerlach magnet is a kind of shutter or valve,
    whose effective areas are squares of sinusoids. Problems involving
    Stern-Gerlach magnets can be solved without quantum mechanics.}

\item TO BE WRITTEN.~$\square$
